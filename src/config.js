    name: "Concrete Crack Detector",
    description: `This app was developed as part of my graduation project. It is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network trained for classifing images of cracked and non-cracked concrete images.

    It works like this: the user selects an image of a concrete surface with cracks, and then the model predicts the presence or absence of concrete cracks in each position of a sliding window that passes over the selected image.
    
    The notebooks used for training the neural network can be found [here](https://github.com/tulio-vieira/concrete-crack-detector-train). The net was then converted into a tensorflowjs model, which can run in the browser.
    
    However, due to bugs of tensorflowjs, the app won't work on mobile or weaker machines. It is also recommended to run it on Google Chrome.`,
